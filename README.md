# 3D Maze Game

A 3D Maze Game developed using Monogame, OpenGL and HLSL. You play a character stuck in a simple maze and need to escape. Collect all three keys in the three different rooms and head back to the portal to win. Beware of the drone that patrols the maze and will follow and shoot you if you get too near.
